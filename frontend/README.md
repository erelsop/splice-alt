## üîß Technical Details

The extension uses the browser's webRequest API to monitor network traffic and capture Splice API responses. When a sample is downloaded, it extracts the metadata from the API response and creates a corresponding JSON file.

**Architecture:**
- **Background Script**: Monitors webRequest API for Splice API calls
- **Content Script**: Provides visual feedback and debug interface
- **Popup Interface**: Settings and statistics management

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3)
- Firefox 78+ (Manifest V2 compatibility)
- Edge 88+
- Other Chromium-based browsers

### Required Permissions
- `webRequest`/`webRequestBlocking`: Monitor Splice API responses
- `downloads`: Create JSON metadata files
- `storage`: Save extension settings
- `activeTab`: Content script injection for feedback
- `https://splice.com/*`: Access to Splice website

## üìä Metadata Captured

The extension captures complete sample metadata including:
- Sample filename, file hash, pack name
- BPM, musical key, tags
- Artist information, genre classification
- Download credits and purchase information
- All fields needed for intelligent categorization

## üéØ Production Ready

This extension is fully functional and ready for daily use:
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling with retry mechanisms  
- ‚úÖ No unauthorized API requests (observes existing traffic)
- ‚úÖ Compatible with Firefox and Chrome
- ‚úÖ Packaged for easy distribution
- ‚úÖ Zero interference with Splice website functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
1. Check that the extension is enabled in the popup
2. Make sure you're on splice.com
3. Verify webRequest permissions are granted
4. Check the browser console for errors

### No JSON Files Created
1. Verify that "Auto-create JSON files" is enabled
2. Make sure you're downloading samples (not just previewing)
3. Check that the extension has permission to access downloads
4. Look for notifications showing metadata capture

### Debug Information
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` on Splice.com to toggle the debug panel
- Check the popup for statistics on captured metadata
- Use the browser's developer tools to check console logs

## File Structure

When working correctly, you should see:
```
~/Downloads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_name.wav          # Downloaded from Splice
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_name.json         # Created by extension
```

The daemon will then process both files and organize them into your library at `~/Music/Samples/SpliceLib/`.
